\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed a sketch recogniton model based on points, which we call SketchPointNet. The approach regards a sketch as a series of points, which take full advantage of the sparsity of the sketch. Our experiments shows that SketchPointNet has a faster recogniton speed and a smaller model size. It is suitable for the development of portable and mobile devices. Besides, SketchPointNet achieve a high recognition accuracy that are close the state-of-the-art approach.
