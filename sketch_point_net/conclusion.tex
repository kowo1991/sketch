\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed a sketch recogniton model based on points, which we call SketchPointNet. The approach regards a sketch as a series of points, which take full advantage of the sparsity of the sketch. So SketchPointNet has less trainable parameters. Our experiments shows that SketchPointNet also achieves a high recognition accuracy compared with image-based approaches. Besides, SketchPointNet achieves best recognition accuracy on TU-Berlin dataset among point-based recognition models.
