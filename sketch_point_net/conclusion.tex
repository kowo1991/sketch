\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose SketchPointNet, a compact deep neural network for robust ketch recognition.
%
Our network directly consumes 2D points on a freehand sketch, which are sparsely distributed in the 2D space. 
%
By sampling and grouping points while considering both temporal order and spatial distribution, local features are learned hierarchically using three mini PointNets. 
%
The experiments on the challenging TU-Berlin dataset demonstrated that our SketchPointNet achieves a high recognition accuracy, and significantly reduces the number of network parameters.
