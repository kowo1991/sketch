\section{Conclusions}

We developed a face fusion method that automatically fuses features of source face into target face. When we consider fusing human faces, there are two parts we are going to fuse, one is face structures, the other is face details. The 68 facial landmarks are enough to align two faces precisely. The illumination of source face might pollute target face. But the method we proposed preserves as much illumination information as possible while decreasing the influence of the illumination of the source face. At mean time, we developed a user interface for letting users control how many features they want from the source face to fuse into the target face. The limitation of our method is clear, we have small tolerance to pose variation. Once two faces are in different poses, warping faces changes the original distributions of face features.
